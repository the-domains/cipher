The palette and textural references of the collection are inspired by Japan's North Island Winter describing the journey from Hokkaidos Northern Circuit through to Wakkanai, the northern most tip of the country.

'White Outs' - Polar White through Storm Grey to Black - clean sharp images, matt finishes - frost rather than ice provide the core to the range which sees a simple palette as the fundamental basis for a collection that is focused on a textural exploration within a single tone.

Accented, highlights of colour, inspired by Winter berries from the region and Geisha Kimonos, alongside the Deep Marine Blue of The Okhotsk Sea, situated to the North East, provide contrast and vibrancy to the more somber Black,  Winter White and Storm Grey.
