Cities contain highly concentrated human activity, they represent to some our glorious high-tech future, yet threaten others with the fear of dystopian social collapse.

Cipher was born in the city and to us the city is utopian representing the very best that human civilisation has to offer. Giving us the possibility to live in a place where clean energy and scientific progress have released humans from the realm of necessity. No longer forced to fight over scarce resources to survive, our Future Metropolis sees the humans who inhabit the near future free to explore ideas, creating new technologies, art and design.

This collection looks ahead, taking our love of modernity and simplicity, drawing inspiration from the cities and landscapes of the near future. Optic almost clinical white is the key to a minimal palette that again utilises textural exploration rather than an overly expansive spectrum of colour, black provides the balance to the collection which is highlighted by silver and vibrant yellow, creating a very clean, forward and modern feel.
